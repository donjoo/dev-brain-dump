# 🧠 Dev Brain Dump

Welcome to **Dev Brain Dump** — my personal space for learning, exploring, and experimenting with different development concepts. Whether it's mastering **React hooks**, solving **LeetCode** problems, diving into **DSA**, or just understanding how stuff works — this repo is where I dump everything I’m currently learning or curious about.

## 🚧 What This Is

This is not a polished project repo.  
It's raw. It's messy. It's real.

It includes:
- 💡 New things I’m exploring
- 🧪 Experiments and test code
- 📓 Learning notes and code snippets
- ⚛️ React breakdowns (e.g., `useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`)
- 🧠 DSA practice and LeetCode solutions

## 🎯 Why This Exists

> _“The best way to remember is to build and break.”_

This repo helps me:
- Keep track of what I learn
- Practice and reinforce concepts
- Solve and reflect on coding problems
- Explore new tools, libraries, and ideas
- Revisit and revise whenever needed

## 🧠 Topics I'm Currently Into

- React (Hooks, Context, Routing, State Management)
- DSA & Problem Solving (Arrays, Strings, Trees, DP, etc.)
- Python scripting and automation
- Web dev best practices
- Clean code, Git, Debugging

 ---

> _Built with bugs, fixes, and lots of "aha!" moments._
