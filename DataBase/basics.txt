#  Database – Definition

A database is an organized collection of data stored electronically, designed 
so you can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data efficiently.
It can store numbers, text, images, videos — anything that needs structured 
or semi-structured access.

DBMS (Database Management System) = software to create, read, update, delete (CRUD) data.

RDBMS (Relational DBMS) = stores data in tables with rows (records) and columns (fields).
 Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

#   Types of Databases (Mainly Two)

1. Relational Database (RDB)

    Structure: Data is stored in tables (rows & columns).

    Model: Based on relations (mathematical term for tables).

    Access Language: SQL (Structured Query Language).

    Data Relationships: Managed using primary keys and foreign keys.

    Schema: Fixed schema — must define table structure before inserting data.

    Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.






2. Non-relational Database (NoSQL)

    Structure: Data is stored in non-tabular formats such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores.

    Model: Optimized for flexibility and scalability.

    Schema: Flexible / schema-less — no fixed table structure required.

    Data Relationships: Embedded documents or references (not strict like foreign keys).

    Examples: MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph), Cassandra (wide-column).


Quick Comparison Table



| Feature        | Relational (SQL)                 | Non-relational (NoSQL)                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Data Format    | Tables (rows, columns)           | Documents, key-value, graph, etc.              |
| Schema         | Fixed (predefined)               | Flexible / schema-less                         |
| Query Language | SQL                              | Various (JSON queries, APIs, etc.)             |
| Scalability    | Vertical (bigger server)         | Horizontal (more servers)                      |
| Best For       | Structured data, complex queries | Unstructured/semi-structured data, scalability |

 is structured, relationships are important, and transactions (ACID) matter.

    Non-relational → when data changes often, schema flexibility is needed, or huge scalability is a priority.
