The 3-Schema Architecture is a framework proposed by the ANSI/SPARC (American National
 Standards Institute / Standards Planning and Requirements Committee) to describe how 
 database systems should be organized in layers.

Its goal is to separate the user’s view, the logical structure, and the physical storage 
of data — so changes in one layer don’t necessarily affect the others.



Layers in the 3-Schema Architecture

There are three levels:
1️⃣ Internal Schema (Physical Level)

    What it is: Describes how data is physically stored in the database.

    Focus: Storage structure, file organization, indexes, access paths.

    Who uses it: Database administrators (DBAs).

    Example:

        How a Customer table is stored on disk.

        Whether the index is a B-tree or hash index.

        Page size and file format.


2️⃣ Conceptual Schema (Logical Level)

    What it is: Describes the logical structure of the entire database — independent of physical details.

    Focus: Entities, attributes, relationships, constraints.

    Who uses it: Database designers.

    Example:

        Customer(customer_id, name, email, phone)

        Relationship: Customer → Orders (One-to-Many).

        Primary and foreign keys.

3️⃣ External Schema (View Level)

    What it is: Describes how individual users or applications see the data (user-specific views).

    Focus: Security, personalization, restricted access.

    Who uses it: Application developers, end users.

    Example:

        A sales rep only sees customers in their region.

        A cashier’s view only shows Product Name and Price, not supplier details.





Why it’s Important

    Data Independence:

        Logical Data Independence → Changes in the logical structure (conceptual schema) don’t affect external schemas.

        Physical Data Independence → Changes in the physical storage (internal schema) don’t affect the logical schema.

    Security → External schemas allow you to hide sensitive data.

    Flexibility → You can optimize storage without changing application code.
