Joins in SQL

Joins are used to retrieve data from multiple tables based on related columns between them.
They are built on the concept of relationships between tables (usually via primary key and foreign key).


1. INNER JOIN

    Definition: Returns only matching rows between two tables based on the join condition.

    Diagram: Intersection of two sets.

    Example:
        SELECT e.name, d.department_name
        FROM Employees e
        INNER JOIN Departments d
        ON e.department_id = d.id;
    Result: Employees that belong to an existing department.


2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

    Definition: Returns all rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table. Non-matching rows from the right table become NULL.

    Diagram: Entire left circle + intersection.

    Example:

        SELECT e.name, d.department_name
        FROM Employees e
        LEFT JOIN Departments d
        ON e.department_id = d.id;

    Result: All employees, even if they don’t belong to a department.


3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

    Definition: Returns all rows from the right table, and matching rows from the left table. Non-matching rows from the left table become NULL.

    Diagram: Entire right circle + intersection.

    Example:

        SELECT e.name, d.department_name
        FROM Employees e
        RIGHT JOIN Departments d
        ON e.department_id = d.id;

    Result: All departments, even if no employee is assigned.


4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)

    Definition: Returns all rows from both tables, with NULLs where no match is found.

    Diagram: Union of both sets.

    Example:

        SELECT e.name, d.department_name
        FROM Employees e
        FULL OUTER JOIN Departments d
        ON e.department_id = d.id;

    Result: All employees and all departments, matched where possible.


5. CROSS JOIN

    Definition: Returns Cartesian product — every row of the first table combined with every row of the second table.

    Example:

SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
CROSS JOIN Departments d;

    Result: If Employees has 10 rows and Departments has 5 rows → 50 rows total.

6. SELF JOIN

    Definition: Joins a table to itself (often to represent hierarchical data).

    Example:

        SELECT e.name AS Employee, m.name AS Manager
        FROM Employees e
        LEFT JOIN Employees m
        ON e.manager_id = m.id;

    Result: Shows each employee with their manager's name.


INNER JOIN → only matches.

LEFT JOIN → all left + matches.

RIGHT JOIN → all right + matches.

FULL JOIN → everything.

CROSS JOIN → everything × everything.

SELF JOIN → table joins with itself.
