 Joins

     join is used to combine columns from one (self-join) or more tables based 
     on the values of the common columns between related tables. The common columns
      are typically the primary key columns of the first table and the foreign key 
      columns of the second table.



Self-join
    A PostgreSQL self-join is a regular join that joins a table to itself using the
    INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN.
    
    Self-joins are very useful for querying hierarchical data or comparing rows within 
    the same table.
    
    SELECT f1.title, f2.title, f1.length FROM film f1 INNER JOIN film f2 ON 
    f1.film_id > f2.film_id AND f1.length = f2.length;
    
    self join is not a special type of join by itself, itâ€™s just a normal join 
    (INNER / LEFT / RIGHT) where the table is joined to itself.

cross join :
        lists all possible combinations
