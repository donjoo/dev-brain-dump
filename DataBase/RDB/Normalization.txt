What is Normalization?

    Definition:
    The process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

    Purpose:

        Eliminate duplicate data.

        Ensure data dependencies make sense.

        Improve consistency.


1NF — First Normal Form

Rule:

    Each column should contain atomic (indivisible) values.

    No repeating groups or arrays.

A table is in First Normal Form (1NF) if all of its columns contain
 only atomic (indivisible) values, and each record is unique.





 2NF — Second Normal Form

Rule:

    Be in 1NF and

    Remove partial dependencies (no non-key attribute should depend 
    on only part of a composite key).
    Every non-key column is fully dependent on the entire primary key,
    not just part of it.

Key Idea
    Partial dependency happens when a non-key column depends on only
    part of a composite primary key (a primary key made of more than 
    one column).
    In 2NF, every non-key column must depend on the whole key.

    (StudentID, CourseID) → StudentName


3NF — Third Normal Form

Rule:

    Be in 2NF and

    Remove transitive dependencies (non-key attributes must depend only 
    on the primary key, not on other non-key attributes).

    EmployeeID → DepartmentID → DepartmentName





2NF: "Does the column depend on the whole key?"

3NF: "Does the column depend only on the key and not on another column?"




BCNF — Boyce–Codd Normal Form

Boyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is like a stronger version of 3NF — it fixes some rare cases 
where a table is in 3NF but still has anomalies because of certain functional dependencies.

Definition
    A table is in BCNF if:
        It is already in 3NF.
        For every functional dependency X → Y, X must be a superkey (i.e., uniquely identify a row).

Key Difference from 3NF
    3NF allows a situation where a non-prime attribute (not part of a key) depends on a candidate key 
    but the determinant is not a superkey.
    BCNF removes that loophole — the left-hand side of every functional dependency must be a superkey.




4NF — Fourth Normal Form


Fourth Normal Form (4NF) goes beyond BCNF to handle a special kind of redundancy caused by multi-valued dependencies.
Definition

    A table is in Fourth Normal Form (4NF) if:

        It is already in Boyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF).

        It has no multi-valued dependencies — except those caused by a candidate key.

What is a Multi-Valued Dependency?

    A multi-valued dependency occurs when one key determines two or more independent sets of values.

    This causes unnecessary duplication in the table.




5NF — Fifth Normal Form (a.k.a. Projection–Join Normal Form)
 also called Projection–Join Normal Form (PJNF) — is the stage of normalization that eliminates redundancy caused by join dependencies.
Definition

    A table is in 5NF if:

        It is already in 4NF.

        It cannot be decomposed into smaller tables without losing data or creating redundancy, except when the decomposition is based on candidate keys.

Key Idea

    Sometimes, information in a table can be reconstructed by joining multiple smaller tables.

    If you can split a table into smaller tables and still get the same data back by joining them, without 
    introducing spurious (fake) rows, then the original table may not be in 5NF.

    5NF ensures that every join dependency is a result of candidate keys — no extra hidden dependencies.










| Form | Removes                 | Key Focus                        |
| ---- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1NF  | Repeating groups        | Atomic values                    |
| 2NF  | Partial dependency      | Full PK dependency               |
| 3NF  | Transitive dependency   | Only PK dependency               |
| BCNF | Key anomalies           | Every determinant is a super key |
| 4NF  | Multi-valued dependency | Independent facts                |
| 5NF  | Join dependency         | Minimal decomposition            |
