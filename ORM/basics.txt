ðŸ”¹ 1. What is ORM?

ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is a technique that allows you to interact with the database using 
Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries.

In Django, ORM translates Python models (classes) into database tables.

This makes your code:

Database-agnostic â†’ you can switch between PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc. without changing your 
Python code.

Easier to maintain â†’ less SQL, more Python.



ðŸ”¹ 4. makemigrations & migrate

When you create or update models, you must tell Django to update the database.

Step 1: makemigrations

Detects changes in models.py

Creates migration files (instructions for database changes).




                ORM lets you use Python classes instead of SQL queries.

                Models = database tables.

                Fields = table columns (with different types).

                makemigrations = prepare instructions.

                migrate = apply to database.

    
Step 2: migrate

Applies those migrations (changes) to the actual database.
