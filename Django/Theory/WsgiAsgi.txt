‚úÖ What is WSGI and ASGI?
üîπ WSGI = Web Server Gateway Interface
üîπ ASGI = Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface

These are interfaces between your Django app and the web server (like gunicorn, uvicorn, or daphne).

They define how the server talks to your Django code



‚úÖ WSGI: (Classic Django, synchronous)

    Introduced in PEP 333

    Works with traditional web requests (GET, POST, etc.)

    Cannot handle real-time communication

    Most Django projects still use this for basic apps.

Example server:

gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application

‚úÖ ASGI: (Modern Django, async-ready)

    Introduced in PEP 484

    Can handle:

        HTTP

        WebSockets

        Async views

        Background tasks, chat apps, etc.

    Fully supported in Django 3.0+

Example server:

uvicorn myproject.asgi:application

‚úÖ Summary Line (for viva):

    WSGI is a standard interface for handling synchronous web requests, 
    while ASGI is its modern, asynchronous counterpart that also supports 
    real-time features like WebSockets. Django uses WSGI by default, but from 
    version 3.0+, it supports ASGI for building async apps.



Django runs on a WSGI (or ASGI) server like gunicorn, uvicorn, or the built-in runserver.

1. runserver (Django's built-in server)

    ‚úÖ Used during development only.

    Comes with Django:
    You run it using

    python manage.py runserver

    üî• Automatically reloads when code changes.

    ‚ùå Not suitable for production ‚Äî slow, lacks performance optimizations, no multi-threading or proper request handling under load.

üöÄ 2. Gunicorn (Green Unicorn)

    A production-grade WSGI server for Python web applications (like Django or Flask).

    WSGI = Web Server Gateway Interface (standard for Python web apps).

    Used to deploy Django apps in production.

    Can be combined with Nginx for better performance and handling static files.

Example:

gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application

    ‚úÖ Robust, supports multiple worker processes.

    ‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt support ASGI (no async support) ‚Äî not ideal for WebSockets or async frameworks like FastAPI.

‚ö° 3. Uvicorn

    A lightweight, lightning-fast ASGI server (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface).

    Designed for async frameworks like FastAPI, but also supports Django with ASGI config (since Django 3.0+).

    Used to run apps that need async support like WebSockets, long polling, or background tasks.

Example:

uvicorn myproject.asgi:application

    ‚úÖ Super fast.

    ‚úÖ Supports both HTTP and WebSocket.

    ‚úÖ Ideal for FastAPI, Django Channels, etc.
