🔷 AbstractUser
    Extends Django’s default user model but allows customization.
✅ You Get:
    All default fields: username, email, first_name, last_name, password, is_staff, is_superuser, etc.
    Built-in authentication and admin integration.
    Can add extra fields.

🔷 AbstractBaseUser
    Gives you full control to define your own authentication system.
✅ You Get:
    Only basic fields: password, last_login.
    You define everything else: username, email, is_active, etc.
    Must specify USERNAME_FIELD, REQUIRED_FIELDS, and a custom UserManager.




######## three types of model inheritance


🔹 1. Abstract Base Classes

✅ Use when you want to share common fields across multiple models, but don't need a table for the base class.
✅ Characteristics:

    No database table is created for the base class.

    Child classes inherit fields.

    Best for reusing common fields/methods.

✅ Example:

from django.db import models

class TimestampedModel(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True

class Post(TimestampedModel):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)

🔹 2. Multi-table Inheritance

✅ Use when each model (including the parent) should have its own database table, and they are linked via a one-to-one relationship.
✅ Characteristics:

    Separate table for each model.

    Used when subclass needs extra fields but still related to parent.

    Supports polymorphism (access all fields from parent or child).

✅ Example:

from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Student(Person):
    grade = models.CharField(max_length=10)

🔹 3. Proxy Models

✅ Use when you want to change the behavior (e.g., ordering, methods) of an existing model without adding new fields.
✅ Characteristics:

    No new table is created.

    Only changes behavior, not structure.

    Commonly used for custom model managers or admin interfaces.

✅ Example:

from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class PersonProxy(Person):
    class Meta:
        proxy = True
        ordering = ['name']

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, {self.name}!"

🧠 Summary Table:
Type	Table Created?	Add Fields?	Use Case
Abstract Base Class	❌ No	✅ Yes	Share common fields
Multi-table Inheritance	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	Extend models with extra fields
Proxy Model	❌ No	❌ No	Change behavior, not structure



Middleware is a hook into Django’s request/response processing. You can use it to modify requests, responses, or handle exceptions globally.


✅ 2. Mixins
Mixins are reusable classes that add specific behavior to views or models when inherited.
🔸 Common in Django CBVs (Class-Based Views):
    LoginRequiredMixin
    PermissionRequiredMixin
    Custom pagination, filtering logic



✅ What is a Manager?
Every Django model has at least one manager, and by default, it's called objects.
A manager allows you to:
    Retrieve records from the database
    Filter, order, and query the data
    Create custom querying logic


🛠️ manage.py in Django

The manage.py file is a command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project in various ways.
✅ Purpose of manage.py
    It acts as a wrapper around django-admin.
    Automatically sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to point to your project’s settings.
    Helps run admin commands like starting a server, applying migrations, creating users, etc.



🌐 What is a Web Server?
A web server is software (and sometimes hardware) that handles HTTP requests from clients (usually browsers) and serves web content (like HTML pages, images, or APIs) in response.


🌐 What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
In simple terms:
    An API is a set of rules that allows two software applications to communicate with each other.



✅ What is a URL?
URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access resources on the web.
🔍 Parts of a URL

Example URL:

https://www.example.com:443/blog/posts/1?sort=latest#comments

Part	Example	Description
Scheme	https	Protocol used (http, https, ftp, etc.)
Host (Domain)	www.example.com	Domain name of the server
Port	443	Optional. Default: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
Path	/blog/posts/1	Specific location/resource on the server
Query String	?sort=latest	Key-value pairs for parameters (optional)
Fragment	#comments	Jumps to a specific section (optional)


🔹 Path Parameters (also called URL Parameters)
✅ Definition:
These are parts of the URL path itself. They are used to identify a specific resource.

🔹 Query Parameters
✅ Definition:
These are key-value pairs passed after the ? in a URL. They are used to filter, sort, or customize the request.


⚙️ Django Context Processors – Making Data Available Everywhere
Context processors in Django are functions that inject variables into the context of all templates automatically, without you having to pass them from every view.



🔌 What is a Socket?
A socket is a low-level communication endpoint that allows two programs (or devices) to 
send and receive data over a network (like the Internet).
🔁 Types of Sockets
Type	Used For	Example Framework
TCP Socket	Reliable, ordered data transfer	HTTP, HTTPS
UDP Socket	Faster, but no guarantee/order	Streaming, games
WebSocket	Persistent 2-way connection	Chat apps, live updates (used in Django Channels, etc.)


🔐 ALLOWED_HOSTS (Django setting)
    What it does:
    Prevents Host header attacks by specifying which domains your Django server will respond to.
    Who checks it:
    ✅ Django server

🌐 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
    What it does:
    Controls which origins (frontend domains) are allowed to make JavaScript fetch/XHR requests to your Django API.
    Who checks it:
    ✅ The browser, based on CORS headers from Django


✅ What is CSRF?

CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery.
    A CSRF attack tricks a logged-in user into making an unwanted request (like transferring money or changing email) from another site.


🔑 What is the SECRET_KEY in Django?
The SECRET_KEY is a random long string that Django uses for cryptographic signing.


❗ Why is DEBUG = True dangerous in production?
    Leaks stack traces and environment variables
    Exposes sensitive settings, possibly your SECRET_KEY
    Makes it easy for attackers to exploit bugs
    ⚠️ NEVER deploy your site with DEBUG = True in production.



🧠 What is Cache?
Cache is a temporary storage mechanism used to store copies of responses or data so future 
requests can be served faster, reduce server load, and improve performance.



🌐 1. Browser Storage (Web Storage API)

It's a way for the browser to store data on the user's device, using:

    ✅ Local Storage

    ✅ Session Storage

These are key-value stores available via JavaScript (window.localStorage and window.sessionStorage), and not sent with HTTP requests (unlike cookies).

🗃️ 2. Local Storage
Feature	Detail
Scope	Domain-wide (same origin only)
Persistence	Persists even after browser/tab is closed
Max Size	~5–10 MB per domain
Accessed via	window.localStorage
Example Use Case	Saving user theme, language preference, tokens (not recommended for sensitive info)


🕓 3. Session Storage
Feature	Detail
Scope	Domain + tab
Persistence	Cleared when tab or browser is closed
Max Size	~5 MB per domain
Accessed via	window.sessionStorage
Example Use Case	Temp data like form progress, search filters


🔐 Authentication
👉 What is it?

    "Who are you?"
    It’s the process of verifying the user's identity.




🔒 Authorization
👉 What is it?
    "What are you allowed to do?"
    It’s about permissions—determining what resources or actions an authenticated user has access to.







    ===========================================================================================================





🛫 What is a Preflight Request?

A Preflight request is a CORS mechanism used by the browser to check with the server if it's safe to send the actual request, especially when that request might affect server data (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE) or uses custom headers.
🔍 When does it happen?

A preflight request is automatically sent by the browser when:

    The request method is not a "simple method" (e.g., GET, HEAD, POST).

    The request uses custom headers (like Authorization, Content-Type: application/json).

    The request includes credentials (withCredentials: true).

🔄 How does it work?

    The browser sends an OPTIONS request to the server.

    The server responds with headers like:

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://frontend.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization

If allowed, the actual request is sent.




🔔 Django Signals — Explained Simply

Signals in Django are like event listeners. They allow different parts of your app to respond to events (like saving a model) without tightly coupling code.



 Internationalization (i18n)

Definition:
The process of preparing your Django app to support multiple languages and cultures.

In Django:
This means marking text in your code so it can be translated later.

Example:

from django.utils.translation import gettext as _

def my_view(request):
    output = _("Welcome to my site.")
    return HttpResponse(output)

The _("text") tells Django this string can be translated.
🟩 Localization (l10n)

Definition:
The process of formatting content (dates, numbers, currency, etc.) according to a specific locale.

In Django:
It auto-formats:

    Dates: 23 July 2025 → 23 juillet 2025 (French)

    Numbers: 1,000.50 → 1.000,50 (German)

🔧 Enable i18n/l10n in settings.py

USE_I18N = True
USE_L10N = True
USE_TZ = True

LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-us'

LANGUAGES = [
    ('en', 'English'),
    ('fr', 'French'),
    ('de', 'German'),
]

LOCALE_PATHS = [BASE_DIR / 'locale']

🌐 Change Language (via URL or middleware)

Django uses LocaleMiddleware to detect user’s preferred language via:

    Cookies

    Accept-Language header

    URL patterns

You can also set it manually:

from django.utils import translation

def my_view(request):
    translation.activate('fr')
    ...

🧠 What is a User Agent?

A User Agent is a string sent by browsers or applications in the HTTP request header to identify themselves to the server.
📦 Example of a User Agent string:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 
(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.5735.199 Safari/537.36

📌 Why is it useful?

It helps the server know:

    Which browser you're using (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

    Which OS you're on (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android)

    Whether it’s a bot (like Googlebot) or mobile device
