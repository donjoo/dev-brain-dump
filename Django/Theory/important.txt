🔐 What is Same-Origin Policy (SOP)?
The Same-Origin Policy is a security rule enforced by web browsers 
that prevents JavaScript running on one origin (domain) from accessing data on another origin.



🌐 What is CORS?
CORS is a browser security feature that allows a server to specify which origins (websites) are 
allowed to access its resources (like APIs).
It exists because of SOP (Same-Origin Policy), which blocks one origin from accessing another’s 
data by default.
CORS is the controlled relaxation of SOP.


🛑 XSS — Cross-Site Scripting
XSS is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a 
website or web app.
This code then runs in other users’ browsers, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or 
even doing actions on behalf of the user.
