NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library that provides:

Fast, efficient arrays (multi-dimensional) called ndarray.

Vectorized operations so you can do math on whole arrays without Python for-loops.

Tools for linear algebra, random numbers, and more.

Think of NumPy as a high-performance replacement for Python lists when you need to work with numbers and matrices.
